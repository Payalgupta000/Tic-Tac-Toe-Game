A simple, text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built in Java for two players. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns to place their mark (either X or O) in an empty cell. The goal is to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does. The game checks for winning conditions after each move and displays the updated board after each turn.
